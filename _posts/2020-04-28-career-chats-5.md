<strong>With apologies to Margaret Wise Brown…</strong>

In the bunker where you work

There was a phone

And a headset

And a picture of your friends

And there were three little snacks brought by your mom

And a laptop all charged up

And an energy drink and the number for your shrink

And random roll of TP

And a bowl full of chips

And your inner voice, whispering, <em>Study</em>

Good luck on exams, good luck on papers

Good luck on reports, good luck getting a little sleep

Good luck with achieving your dreams

Good luck with the future*

Good luck to each and every Eagle…good luck to YOU!

*PSA: The Career Center is here to help you even after graduation! All our services are free to you and we will be operating from our bunkers, available via email, phone and Zoom!
