<h4>Hello, everyone!</h4>
This week I’m going to talk about job searching during a pandemic, based upon my extensive experience in the matter. Lol, not really. Ancient though most adults may seem, and much as some of us like to drone on about, “Back in my day…” there are none of us here at the Career Center (CCPD) who have ever lived through anything quite like this.

And, that means that you can view this as an exciting time. There is going to be a LOT of struggle, don’t get me wrong. But there is also the chance to forge a new future. Maybe a better future. One where we use technology more to create balanced work/life situations. One where we think a little more about what we truly need instead of what we simply want. But back to the topic at hand…

I started my research for this post by simply Googling <em>Job Search, March 2020</em> and found a quaint little <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kourtneywhitehead/2020/03/01/3-things-you-need-to-know-about-a-march-job-search/#6e86a4f67473">piece</a> dated March 1, 2020 from Forbes. I knew it was already dated, but I decided to read it anyway and I was glad I did because it offers some good advice that holds true now more than ever. I’ll share one nugget with you, and I urge you to read the rest in the link: <em>…<strong>it’s still wise to put your most aggressive networking and job search push out this month. Don’t procrastinate any longer, because what lies ahead is hard to predict.</strong></em>

Translate “this month” into April and you’ve got your marching orders. There are always jobs out there. They are going to be fewer and harder to come by until we get back on track, yes, but that is why you want to start laying the groundwork NOW, or continuing the momentum you already started earlier in the year.

To that end, I’m going to talk about the most pressing question I heard from students in the past couple of weeks: “What should I do to follow up with or initiate contact with employers during this time?”

First, if you have had any actual interviews and did not write a <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/job-interview-thank-you-letter-examples-2063964">thank you note</a>, do that now.

Second, if you have applied to jobs but have not heard back, reach out with a quick email or phone call to follow up. In your communication, stress that you know things are a bit up in the air right now, but remind them of your qualifications, your adaptability and your eagerness to contribute to their mission. Now more than ever, employers are going to be looking for workers who are able to flex and adapt so if you are that person, be sure to tell them!

Third, if you had some potential contacts out there that you have been meaning to reach out to but haven’t, do it. Maybe a family friend told you she would “get you the name of someone in HR” but hasn’t. Reach out to her, ask how she is doing, tell her you know things are hectic, but you want to check in with her about that contact. Be polite, be considerate, but be persistent. Check in again. And again. There’s a fine line between being “politely persistent” and a stalker, so do stay on the right side of that, but keep in touch.

Finally, ask your contacts not only about the job you were interested in previously, but about other opportunities in their organization, or about other people they might know who you could reach out to. Grow your network, keep on extending yourself, and be patient. Job searches are seldom quick or easy but when approached with a growth mindset, you can remind yourself that you are learning and growing throughout the process.

What if you have no prior contacts or have not yet started applying for jobs? Not to worry! Today is a new day and you can get on it. I will address where to start when you have no idea of what to do in the next blog post!

Til then,

Your Career Coach, Mary Becelia
