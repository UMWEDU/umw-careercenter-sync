<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Peace Corps and the University of Mary Washington Announce New Peace Corps Prep Program</strong></p>
WASHINGTON – Peace Corps and the University of Mary Washington today announced a new partnership centered on an undergraduate certificate program called Peace Corps Prep.

Students in the Peace Corps Prep program, scheduled to launch at UMW in June, will combine targeted coursework with hands-on experience, building the competencies needed to be strong Peace Corps volunteers or other intercultural fieldworkers.

Peace Corps Prep will be structured as an interdisciplinary certificate program housed in the Center for Career and Professional Development. Students will learn about and practice leadership, intercultural competence, foreign language, and a professional sector of their choice such as education, health, or the environment. These skills will give them a competitive edge when applying for Peace Corps service, and can be built upon and marketed throughout their careers.

The Peace Corps has Peace Corps Prep partnerships with more than 75 leading academic institutions nationwide. Established in 2007, the program aims to meet the demand for Peace Corps volunteers with a broad and relevant set of expertise, and to support schools’ efforts to provide substantive, globally focused experiences for their students. For more information, go to <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.peacecorps.gov_volunteer_university-2Dprograms_peace-2Dcorps-2Dprep_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=kVY3MuRuOLjvBc3QFpYNFQ&amp;r=uyi6CbkSi6n9sDp8zqXXFA&amp;m=gQybidM5Kgpt9dEmavatwNU5Uvn2OcAzhooYVUN1VvY&amp;s=5v_YO9UkbKAYlLK18XoZa1T-RkNebuLgrlkCX2KTAm4&amp;e=">www.peacecorps.gov/pcprep</a>.

Students in the program will have the opportunity to participate in organized service-learning and leadership development programs via UMW’s Center for Honor and Leadership Service. In addition, students will have the opportunity to study abroad on a variety of short- or long-term programs to gain cross-cultural adaptation skills via UMW’s Center for International Education.

Since 1961, UMW has had 253 Peace Corps volunteers, with 13 students currently serving today.
