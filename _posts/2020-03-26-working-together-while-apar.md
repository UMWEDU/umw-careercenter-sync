<span data-contrast="auto">Dear UMW Students,</span>

<span data-contrast="auto">I know and you know that this is a tough time and that we are all coping as best we can. I’ve read a lot about that and I know you have too. Please be aware that the UMW Career Center (CCPD) is right there with you in the </span><span data-contrast="auto">'mixedupcrazyconfused'</span><span data-contrast="auto"> swirl of emotions that you are experiencing. We also share in the sense that the world has been rocked and perhaps permanently shifted in the past couple of weeks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}" data-wac-het="1"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">But I’m not going to dwell on that in this first issue of this </span><span data-contrast="auto">blog</span><span data-contrast="auto">. Maybe in a future one, when a little of the dust has settled. Right now, I want to let you all know that WE ARE HERE FOR YOU. The CCPD staff is working our normal hours, figuring out how we can help you navigate this new era. Do we have all the answers? Not going to lie: No. Are we planning and brainstorming to come up with options, ideas, ways to help you? Absolutely! Do we want to hear from you </span><span data-contrast="auto">regarding</span><span data-contrast="auto"> what you need/want/think? 100 times yes!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}" data-wac-het="1"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">I hope that the articles, links and information in </span><span data-contrast="auto">the newsletter you just received</span><span data-contrast="auto"> have been helpful to you. I also hope that you’re taking some time for self-care. Developing a routine with sleep/exercise/good food. Taking time to get outdoors and enjoy the natural world. Picking up a book </span><span data-contrast="auto">for pleasure and to give your eyes a break from screens. We’ll be sharing more tips along these lines in future issues as well and would love to hear from you </span><span data-contrast="auto">on</span><span data-contrast="auto"> what you’re doing to stay safe and sane!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}" data-wac-het="1"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">On that note I’ll sign off. Back with more next week,</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}" data-wac-het="1"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Your Career Coach</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}" data-wac-het="1">, Mary Becelia</span>
