The VCOM Guaranteed Admissions Interview Program guarantees qualified UMW pre-medical students interviews for admission into the Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine (VCOM).

Students who qualify for the guaranteed admissions interview program will interview on campus at VCOM with three (3) VCOM faculty/administrators and participate in the designated interview day activities.  An interview does not guarantee admission into VCOM.  Following the interview, the VCOM admissions committee will make an admissions decision.

To qualify, a UMW pre-medical student must have, among other things, completed all required premed courses specified by VCOM, with the majority completed at the institution,* obtain a competitive score on the medical college admissions test (MCAT), have completed adequate hours of health care and community service hours, and submit a formal application to VCOM through the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (“AACOMAS”) by Sept 1 of the open application cycle.

*If the candidate is a transfer student, he/she must have completed at least 30 credit hours at UMW and be approved by VCOM to participate in this agreement.

For a complete list of requirements and for more information, please email the <a href="mailto:sgallik@umw.edu">UMW Pre-Health Advisor, Professor Stephen Gallik</a>.
