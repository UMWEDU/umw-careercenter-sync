Internships provide structured learning experiences and must be evaluated by a faculty member and approved in advance by the department you are seeking academic credit from. Credit is only awarded for internships that incorporate a hands-on experience per the duties outlined in the contract, and includes academic components which are determined at the discretion of your faculty sponsor. Requested internships should provide an opportunity for you to apply and supplement knowledge gained in the classroom. Academic departments have the final decision for the approval of an academic internship.

Interested in doing an internship for credit? Follow the steps below.

<strong>Step 1: Check with your Academic Department</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Speak to your department about their requirements for receiving credit for an internship. Requirements vary by department. Review the most current version of the academic catalog.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 2: Choose a Faculty Sponsor within your Department</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Within your department, choose a faculty sponsor and speak to them about the type of academic work that will be required throughout the internship, and ways in which you will meet throughout the semester. Ask them how you will be evaluated.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 3: Search for and Secure an Internship</strong>
