<h2>POST-9/11 GI BILL</h2>
</div>
<div class="veteran-main-block">
<div class="right-img-block"></div>
Veterans looking for financial assistance for their education can turn to the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs’ Post-9/11 GI Bill. Tuition and fees, housing, and books are among the provisions partially or fully covered for veterans who served at least 90 aggregate days of active duty following Sept. 10, 2001. Monies can be used toward education at public and private colleges, universities, and trade schools as well as for licensing, tutorial assistance, and testing, such as the LSAT or SAT. The minimum benefit, at 40 percent, is available for tuition and fees for veterans who served between 90 days and six months while the maximum benefit, at 100 percent, is available for tuition and fees for veterans who served at least 36 months of active duty.
<p class="blck">Veterans are eligible for these benefits for up to 15 years from their last period of active duty ending with an Honorable Discharge that consisted of at least 90 days of service after the above September date. Specific benefits are also available to those who have served for at least 30 consecutive days and been honorably discharged due to a service-related disability. With at least six years of qualifying service and still serving, unused benefits can be transferred to a spouse or beneficiaries under this plan, but generally, an additional four years of active duty service are required.</p>

THE WHITE HOUSEThe full impact of the Post-9/11 GI Bill can be understood through this 2013 White House press release that showcases the one-millionth veteran to become the recipient of the bill’s benefits.

<div class="veteran-main-block">
<h2>YELLOW RIBBON PROGRAM</h2>
<div class="right-img-block"></div>
Veterans who want to attend a private or a public out-of-state school could end up paying some of the costs themselves. The Veterans Affairs (VA) sets a national maximum covered for tuition and fees at private schools per academic year and only pays up to the resident rate for public schools. The Yellow Ribbon Program has been set up to help off-set some of these costs, and allows schools to enter into agreements with the VA through which the VA matches every dollar the school contributes toward tuition and fees beyond the maximum covered by the Post 9/11 GI Bill. This amount can help veterans at the 100% Post 9/11 GI Bill tier cover much or all of the difference between what the school charges and what the Post 9/11 GI Bill pays.
<ul>
 	<li>THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS - Veterans can find specific details about the Yellow Ribbon Program on this site, including that the school of their choice must agree to participate and cannot offer Yellow Ribbon benefits to more than the maximum number of veterans specified in their participation agreement. <a href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/yellow_ribbon.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">READ MORE</a></li>

Veterans returning to college may need help adjusting to civilian life to succeed. They may also want assistance improving their academic and study skills, or even just in understanding how to select a college. None of it is easy, and our list of resources below can help veterans to navigate these sticky areas. With up to 88 percent of veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars dropping out of college, according to <a href="http://www.stripes.com/how-many-student-veterans-graduate-no-one-knows-1.203125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stars and Stripes</a>, upping the chance for success may be a move in the right direction.

Many veterans need help brushing up on basic math and writing skills, or just in understanding the expectations of a college-level program. Veterans can improve their skills through resources online, as well as through programs available through campus veterans’ centers. They may also wonder what kinds of degrees or majors to study. Finally, they may want to know a how to select a school to attend, if they can obtain credit for classes taken during service, and whether online education is something worth pursuing. That is the focus of this section, and we’ve fully fleshed out the list of resources below to help veterans obtain answers to those questions.
