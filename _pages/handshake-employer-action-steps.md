<strong>EMPLOYER ACTION STEPS</strong>
Employers who are currently using the Employ-An-Eagle system need to take all of the URGENT ACTIONS listed below. NEXT STEPS can be completed as needed and as the beginning dates allow.
<strong>URGENT ACTIONS</strong>
Beginning: April 17, 2017
Action: Review your open positions in the current Employ-An-Eagle system.  You will be able to complete recruiting on any open position through May 30, 2017.  After May 30th, you will need to re-post any unfilled positions in Handshake to continue recruiting.
Action: Check the e-mail address that you use to log into the current Employ-An-Eagle system for an invitation to create your new account on Handshake.  If you already use Handshake at another college or university, you may submit a request to add the University of Mary Washington to your list of approved schools.
