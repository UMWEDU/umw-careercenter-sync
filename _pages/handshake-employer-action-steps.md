<strong>EMPLOYER ACTION STEPS</strong>
Employers who are currently using the Employ-An-Eagle system and wish to transition to Handshake need to take all of the ACTIONS listed below.

&nbsp;
Beginning: April 17, 2017
Action: Review your open positions in the current Employ-An-Eagle system.  You will be able to complete recruiting on any open position through May 30, 2017.  After May 30th, you will need to re-post any unfilled positions in Handshake to continue recruiting.

&nbsp;
On: June 1, 2017
Action: Check the e-mail address that you use to log into the current Employ-An-Eagle system for an invitation to create your new account on Handshake.  If you already use Handshake at another college or university, you may submit a request to add the University of Mary Washington to your list of approved schools. The current system powering Employ-An-Eagle  goes offline and Handshake, comes online. Students will also be able to start using Handshake on this date. You may begin to post your positions in Handshake.
