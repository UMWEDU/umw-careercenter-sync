The UMW Career Center has a strict policy for missing an appointment or an employer event. If a cancellation is necessary, please contact the Career Center at 540-654-5646. A student is assigned no show status for any of these reasons:
<ul>
 	<li>Canceling a scheduled interview or employer event less than 48 hours prior to the scheduled date/time (48 hours’ notice will give the Career Center an opportunity to inform the employer in advance and possibly allow another student to take the time slot).</li>
 	<li>Not attending a scheduled interview.</li>
 	<li>Not attending an employer event where the student has pre-registered.</li>
</ul>
If any of the above situations occur, the following actions will be taken:

<strong>First No Show</strong>

Your Handshake account will be blocked and you will be ineligible to activate your account or schedule additional on-campus interviews or register for employer events until an apology letter is submitted. In addition, the Career Center will contact your Academic Advisor to notify them of the missed interview. See below for instructions.

<strong>Second No Show</strong>

Your Handshake account will be blocked and you will be ineligible to activate your account or schedule additional on-campus interviews or register for employer events for the remainder of the semester. See below for instructions.

<strong>Third No Show</strong>

Your Handshake account will be blocked and you will be ineligible to activate your account or schedule additional on-campus interviews or register for employer events for one calendar year. See below for instructions.

<strong>To remove the hold from your account</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>It is the student’s responsibility to obtain the employer’s contact information. E-mail <a href="mailto:ccpd@umw.edu">ccpd@umw.edu</a> to request the contact information for the employer representative.</li>
 	<li>E-mail a letter of apology to the recruiter and copy Rose Maddox, Operations and Employer Relations Manager, <a href="mailto:rwagner@umw.edu">rwagner@umw.edu</a>.</li>
 	<li>Your account will be unblocked within five working days for a first no show, after one semester for a second no show, and after one calendar year for a third no show.</li>
</ul>
If the student fails to do the aforementioned tasks, his/her Handshake account will remain blocked.
