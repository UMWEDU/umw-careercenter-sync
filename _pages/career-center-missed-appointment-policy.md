Not attending your scheduled Career Center appointment without canceling in advance results in a No Show status. Canceling (for any reason) is a professional courtesy that allows our Career Coaches to open up a time slot for another student. In addition, if you arrive more than 15 minutes late, this will result in a 'no show' status and you will be asked to reschedule.

To cancel your appointment, please contact the Career Center at 540-654-5646 or <a href="mailto:ccpd@umw.edu">ccpd@umw.edu</a>.

<strong>First No Show</strong>

The Career Center will send an email regarding the missed appointment.

<strong>Second No Show</strong>

The Career Center will send an email regarding the missed appointment to you and your Academic Advisor.

<strong>Third No Show</strong>

The Career Center will send an email regarding the missed appointment to you and your Academic Advisor. You will also lose your privilege to schedule appointments for the remainder of the academic year.
