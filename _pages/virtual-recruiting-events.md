Virtual events are an impactful way for employers to connect with students. It allows students to ask live questions and interact with employers in their field of interest.

If you would like to host a virtual event, you must submit a <a href="https://support.joinhandshake.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045228793-Hosting-Virtual-Events-for-Core-Employers-">virtual event request via Handshake. </a>

Once your event has been submitted and approved, the UMW Career Center will market to students through the following outlets:
<ul>
 	<li>Career Center Social Media Accounts: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</li>

 	<li>Schedule at a time that does not conflict with class schedules. Consider evenings or weekends. Tuesday-Thursday are typically the best days to host a session.</li>
 	<li>Events should be a maximum of 45 minutes. Be sure to leave time at the end for questions.</li>
 	<li>Review all privacy policies for the platform you are using.</li>
