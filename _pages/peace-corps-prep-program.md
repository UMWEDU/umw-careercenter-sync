<h2><strong>About</strong></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
For 12 years, the Peace Corps has ranked the University of Mary Washington among the nation’s top-producing colleges for alumni now serving as Peace Corps volunteers. UMW's Peace Corps Prep program will prepare current students for  international development fieldwork and potential Peace Corps service. To accomplish this, students will build four core competencies through interrelated coursework, hands-on experience professional development support, and professional savvy and leadership.
<h2><strong>Competencies
</strong></h2>
Leveraging concrete knowledge and skills is central to on the ground international development work. Through this PC Prep program, you will begin to build a professional specialty, which should serve your career well whether or not you become a Peace Corps Volunteer.

With this learning objective, you will deepen your cultural    agility through a mix of three introspective courses in which you learn about others while reflecting  upon your own self in relation to others.The goal is for you to build your capacity to shift perspective and behavior around relevant cultural differences.</h6>
