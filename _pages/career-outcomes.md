The UMW Center for Career and Professional Development collects outcomes on our graduates using the NACE (National Association of Colleges and Employers) First Destination Survey.

<a href="http://www.naceweb.org/job-market/graduate-outcomes/first-destination/">NACEâ€™s First-Destination Survey</a> captures information regarding how new college graduates fare in their careers within six months of graduation. The annual initiative provides clear, concise, and consistent data on the outcomes associated with a college education on a national scale.

In addition to providing outcomes for individual classes, the First-Destination Survey is designed to provide trends data over time to inform the discussion about the value of higher education.
