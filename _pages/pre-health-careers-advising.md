The basic liberal arts and science courses offered at Mary Washington prepare students for entering nursing, physical therapy, dental hygiene, medical technology, occupational therapy, ophthalmic technology, optometry, physician assistant, and pharmacy programs.

Pre-medicine, pre-dentistry and pre-veterinary medicine are career paths, not majors. Students in pursuit of one of these clinical careers may select any of the major programs at the University. Although most pre-medical, pre-dental, and pre-veterinary students major in one of the sciences, students can easily major in one of the humanities or social sciences and complete their pre-medical courses as electives.

During their first year, students must give careful attention to the professional school admission requirements, which are available on the respective school websites. The pre-health advisor, Dr. Steve Gallik, Professor of Biology, is available to help students select courses that meet these requirements and prepare for the relevant admission examination.
