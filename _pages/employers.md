<strong>UMW Fall 2020 Recruiting Options</strong>

<em>Note: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are only allowing virtual recruiting options for the Summer 2020 and Fall 2020 semesters.</em>
<div class="one-half first">
<h2>Post a Job or Internship</h2>
Handshake is UMW’s official job and internship database. Handshake allows you the opportunity to create an employer profile, post part-time and full-time jobs, internships, and volunteer opportunities, view student and alumni resumes, post events, and message our students. It is free for both employers and students to use.

For more information, visit our <a href="https://www.umw.edu/careercenter/handshake/">Handshake Overview Page</a> and click on the ‘Employers’ tab.
<h2>Host A Virtual Recruiting Event</h2>
Our fall and spring fairs, as well as at targeted employer events, are heavily marketed to and attended by our talented UMW students. Email ccpd@umw.edu for more information. Note: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will not be hosting a Fall 2020 Job &amp; Internship Fair. Instead, learn more about our Industry Weeks.
