Even after you’ve graduated, we are here to help! As a UMW alum, you are invited to use all of the same career resources available to our current students, including <a href="https://www.umw.edu/careercenter/students/appointments/">booking an appointment</a> with a counselor and attending our <a href="http://www.umw.edu/careercenter/events/">events</a> (with the exception of some site visits that may be for current students only). We also encourage you to join our LinkedIn Alumni Group, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3135259">Eagle Connections</a>, to network with other UMW alums and make career connections.

If you are an employer, the Career Center also offers many opportunities for UMW alumni to interact with and assist current students. Explore our <a href="https://www.umw.edu/careercenter/employers/">recruiting options</a> for information on ways to get involved.

If you are interested in any of these options, please contact our office at 540-654-5646 or email <a href="mailto:ccpd@umw.edu">ccpd@umw.edu.</a>
