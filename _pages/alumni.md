Even after you’ve graduated, we are here to help! As a UMW alum, you are invited to use all of the same career resources available to our current students, including <a href="https://www.umw.edu/careercenter/students/appointments/">booking an appointment</a> with a counselor and attending our <a href="http://www.umw.edu/careercenter/events/">events</a> (with the exception of some site visits that may be for current students only). We also encourage you to join our LinkedIn Alumni Group, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3135259">Eagle Connections</a>, to network with other UMW alums and make career connections.

If you are an employer, the Career Center also offers many opportunities for UMW alumni to interact with and assist current students. Explore our <a href="https://www.umw.edu/careercenter/employers/">recruiting options</a> for information on ways to get involved.
<h2>Alumni Meet-ups</h2>
New this year, alumni meet-ups, hosted in the Center for Career and Professional Development, are opportunities for alumni to lead career-based talks on field-specific topics with small groups (no more than 15) of selected current students. Meet-ups are scheduled twice each month and must be planned at least a month in advance. We are looking for alumni interested in facilitating such sessions.

If you are interested in any of these options, please contact our office at 540-654-5646 or email <a href="mailto:ccpd@umw.edu">ccpd@umw.edu.</a>
