<div class="text-block">

The Center for Career and Professional Development will be holding an Education Fair for UMW students and the surrounding community at the Stafford Campus on March 22, 2017 from 5-7 p.m. This fair is for school systems/education students. Students will have an opportunity to learn about a  variety of school systems and speak to representatives about their application process.

There is no cost or registration for students/alumni/community members to attend.
<h3><strong>School systems</strong>:</h3>
The  Education Fair offers you the opportunity to discuss employment options with UMW students. The University of Mary Washington has selective admission standards, and a curriculum that emphasizes writing, public speaking, and problem-solving skills, both in and out of the classroom. Our graduates make excellent teachers, and our Education Fair is the perfect forum for meeting many of them.

<strong>Note: There is a $50 Registration Fee which includes two representatives. Additional representatives will be $50 each.</strong>

This cost includes a six foot table for displays and marketing materials, two chairs, promotion on our website and throughout the University, wireless capabilities, electrical outlet access, if requested/available, and refreshments during the fair.
