The Center for Career and Professional Development at the University of Mary Washington invites you to participate in our Job &amp; Internship Fair which will be held on <b>February 19, 2020 from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m. in the University Center, Chandler Ballroom on the Fredericksburg campus.</b>

From 11 a.m. - 12 p.m., students who completed a career fair preparation program have the opportunity to meet with employers an hour earlier than the general student population. Those students will also be wearing a special pin to signify their extra preparation.

If inclement weather affects the area on this date and UMW is closed, the snow date for the event is March 17, 2019

This fair offers you the opportunity to recruit high quality UMW students and alumni for your organization. The University of Mary Washington has selective admission standards and a curriculum that emphasizes writing, public speaking, and problem-solving skills. Our graduates make great employees and interns, and this fair is the perfect forum for meeting many of them.
