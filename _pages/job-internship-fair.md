The Center for Career and Professional Development at the University of Mary Washington will be hosting our Fall Job &amp; Internship Fair on <b>October 24, 2019 from 10 a.m. - 3 p.m. in the University Center, Chandler Ballroom on the Fredericksburg campus.</b>

From 10 a.m. â€“ 11 a.m., students who completed a career fair preparation program have the opportunity to meet with employers an hour earlier than the general student population. Those students will also be wearing a special pin to signify their extra preparation.

This fair offers you the opportunity to recruit high quality UMW students and alumni for your organization. The University of Mary Washington has selective admission standards and a curriculum that emphasizes writing, public speaking, and problem-solving skills. Our graduates make great employees and interns, and this fair is the perfect forum for meeting many of them.

Email invitations to employers will be sent in early to mid September. To be added to the invitation list, please email ccpd@umw.edu
