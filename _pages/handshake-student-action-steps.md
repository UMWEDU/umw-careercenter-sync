<strong>STUDENT ACTION STEPS</strong>
Handshake will be launching in Summer 2017
<strong>URGENT ACTIONS</strong>
Deadline: May 30, 2017
Action: Download your resume(s), cover letter(s), and other relevant documents from the old Employ-An-Eagle  system. After this date, your documents will not be available and we will not be able to retrieve them for you.
Beginning: May 30, 2017
Action: Upload your resume to the new system for review. The CCPD has implemented a mandatory resume review requirement. Until your resume is reviewed and approved you will not be able to apply for jobs or internship positions.
<strong>NEXT STEPS</strong>
Beginning:  May 30, 2017
Action: You can log in to the Handshake system!  Be sure to set-up your Handshake profile and upload a current resume.  Your uploaded resume will be reviewed and, if necessary, you may need to make edits to your resume, before you will be able to apply for internship, and employment opportunities listed in the system.
If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact our office at 540-654-5646 or email us at ccpd@umw.edu
