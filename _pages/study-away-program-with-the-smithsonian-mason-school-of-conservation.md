The Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation (SMSC) represents a powerful partnership that now includes the University of Mary Washington. SMSC offers a range of hands-on, interdisciplinary programs in conservation for undergraduates, graduate students, professionals, and high school students.

Through an agreement with UMW, undergraduate students at UMW can “study away” at the SMSC for a semester at their facility in Front Royal, VA. Smithsonian scientists, George Mason faculty, and experts from conservation organizations around the world provide direct connections to the most current teaching, and research work in the field. Students thrive in a collaborative atmosphere of creative, analytical thinking, and alumni of the program become part of a lifelong global community.

Interested students should have earned at least 45 UMW credits and some courses of study may require specific upper-level prerequisites in biology. Once admitted, UMW students choose one of several 16-credit tracks of courses that transfer back to UMW. Students interested in pursuing this opportunity should connect as early as possible with the <a href="mailto:agriffit@umw.edu">faculty director in the UMW Department of Biological Sciences</a>.
