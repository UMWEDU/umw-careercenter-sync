Internships provide excellent opportunities for students to gain professional work experience and test out a career field of interest. Students can develop and enhance their skill set and knowledge base, build a network of professional contacts, and learn how to manage the multitude of responsibilities that come with a career. On the flip side, their energy, enthusiasm, and creativity provide much needed assistance to organizations looking for the innovation and determination that only college students can provide. It is a “win-win” situation that is not only valued but expected in today’s competitive job market.
<h2>Posting an internship</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.umw.edu/careercenter/employers/internships/role/">Understand your role</a> with academic credit internships.</li>
 	<li>Determine the responsibilities for the internship you are creating. The National Association of Colleges and Employers <a href="http://www.naceweb.org/advocacy/position-statements/united-states-internships.aspx">position statement on internships</a> is a good place to start.</li>
 	<li>Create an employer account and post the position on Handshake, UMW’s online job and internship database.</li>
 	<li>Make sure to include application instructions for the student, including letting them know if you’d like them to apply via email, a website, etc.</li>
 	<li>Once you have interviewed qualified candidates and chosen an intern, if the student is interested in doing the internship for credit, they will work through the Center for Career and Professional Development to submit the required paperwork.</li>
</ul>
We are happy to help with every step along the way. Feel free to contact Internship Coordinator Bianca Hightower at <a href="mailto:bfaison@umw.edu">bfaison@umw.edu</a> if you have questions.
