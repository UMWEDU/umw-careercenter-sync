The 3+3 Accelerated Programs offer highly motivated undergraduate students a fast track to earn both a bachelor’s degree and a law degree in six, rather than seven, years of study.

<strong>What are the advantages of the 3+3 Program?</strong>

The 3+3 Program provides a fast track to a career in law, allowing you to join the legal profession one year earlier. After three years of undergraduate study, you do not return to the undergraduate college for a senior year; rather, you enter Scalia Law as a full-time, first year law student. The program will save you one year’s worth of tuition and time.

<strong>How does it work?</strong>

UMW students must finish major and general education requirements by the end of the third year, and make a formal timely application to GMU's law school (including LSAT scores). The fourth year is spent at GMU as a first year law student. The UMW undergraduate degree would be awarded from UMW following successful completion of the first year at GMU's law school.  Enrolling in the 3-3 program does not guarantee entrance nor lock one into going to GMU's law school.
