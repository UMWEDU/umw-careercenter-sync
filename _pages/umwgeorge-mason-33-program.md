The 3+3 Accelerated Programs offer highly motivated undergraduate students a fast track to earn both a bachelor's degree and a law degree in six, rather than seven, years of study.
<h3><strong>What are the advantages of the 3+3 Program?</strong></h3>
The 3+3 Program provides a fast track to a career in law, allowing you to join the legal profession one year earlier. After three years of undergraduate study, you do not return to the undergraduate college for a senior year; rather, you enter Scalia Law as a full-time, first year law student. The program will save you one yearâ€™s worth of tuition and time.
