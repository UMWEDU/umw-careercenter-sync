We are pleased to announce the fulfillment of one of the University's key strategic goals with the selection of the first executive director of our Center for Career and Professional Development. Please join in welcoming Dr. Paul Binkley, whose employment will begin June 25. He has more than 20 years experience in the fields of career services, student affairs, international development, and higher education management.

Binkley comes to UMW from the Homewood Career Center at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), where he served as director of the Student Career Development Team. In that role, he managed a staff of career coaches who implemented an industry-based service model that included group, one-on-one, and class-based services to all Homewood undergraduate and graduate students, and young alumni.

He will work with similar constituents here. Binkley's arrival at UMW solidifies the University's commitment to meeting statewide workforce needs as well as its conviction that a liberal arts education is the essence of career and life readiness. "I am thrilled about the opportunity to work with Dr. Binkley on bringing to life a vision that makes preparation for the transition from college to career and life after Mary Washington a central aspect of the student experience," said Tim O'Donnell, Associate Provost for Academic Engagement and Student Success.

Prior to his job at JHU, Binkley worked in Monrovia, Liberia, for more than three years, first as an education officer with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and then as the resident director for the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI).

Before his tenure in Africa, Binkley spent 13 years working in career development at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., with the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration and the Elliott School of International Affairs. He has also worked in Afghanistan, Barbados, Iraq, Tajikistan, and several other countries in Europe and Africa.

Recognized for his significant knowledge and expertise in the area of federal careers, Binkley teamed with Katherine Troutman, a noted federal careers expert, to author the book <em>Students’ Federal Career Guide — How Students, Student Vets, and Recent Grads Land a Federal Job</em>, now in its third edition. He holds a doctorate in higher education administration from The George Washington University, a master’s degree in international affairs from the University of Kentucky, and a certificate in Human Performance Improvement. Originally from central Minnesota, Binkley is a certified MBTI facilitator, and a Board Certified Coach.
