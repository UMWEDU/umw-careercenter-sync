Due to an agreement with George Mason University, UMW students have an accelerated pathway to a Master of Science degree from the Volgenau School of Engineering (VSE) at George Mason University. Students express interest through an interest form available from the Assistant Dean of Arts and Sciences at UMW.

Approved students enroll as non-degree students in VSE during their senior year at UMW and may take up to 9-credits of graduate level coursework in one of several programs including Applied Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Analytics Engineering, Operations Research, Statistics, and Systems Engineering. Upon completion of their senior year at UMW, students in the program can use their earned credits from GMU as electives at UMW, and can then matriculate to GMUâ€™s Volgenau School of Engineering having already completed nine credits toward a Master of Science degree program. In most cases, students will be able to earn their MS in only one year after graduation from UMW.

Additional details about the application process can be obtained from the <a href="https://cas.umw.edu/cas-deans-office/">Dean's Office.</a>
