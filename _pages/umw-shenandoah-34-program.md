The 3+4 Accelerated Program offer highly motivated undergraduate students a fast track to earn both a bachelor’s degree and a Doctor of Pharmacy degree in seven, rather than eight, years of study.

<strong>What are the advantages of the 3+4 Program?</strong>

The 3+4 Program provides a fast track to a career in pharmacy, allowing you to join the profession one year earlier. After three years of undergraduate study, you do not return to the undergraduate college for a senior year; rather, you enter Bernard J Dunn School of Pharmacy as a full-time, first year pharmacy student. The program will save you one year’s worth of tuition and time.

<strong>How does it work?</strong>

UMW students must finish major* and general education requirements by the end of the third year, and make a formal timely application to SU’s BJD School of Pharmacy (including GRE scores and volunteer hours). The fourth year is spent at SU as a first year pharmacy student. The UMW undergraduate degree would be awarded from UMW following successful completion of the first year at SU BJD School of Pharmacy.  Enrolling in the 3-4 program does not guarantee entrance nor lock one into going to SU’s School of Pharmacy.

*Biology majors may use the first year at BJD School of Pharmacy to complete 8 elective credits in the Biology major.
