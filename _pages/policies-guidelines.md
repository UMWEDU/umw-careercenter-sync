The University of Mary Washington Career Center has created guidelines and policies for all postings and recruitment done through our job portal, Handshake.

All posts must adhere to the following standards:
<ul>
 	<li>All employer profiles must include an email address, phone number and location for the company’s contact. Emails must be with a company domain (those using gmail, yahoo, Hotmail, etc. will not be approved). Address must be verifiable through Google Maps.</li>
 	<li>If other schools have flagged your organization within Handshake or if you have a low trust score, we reserve the right to deny your request to recruit.</li>
 	<li>Postings will not be approved if students must pay for opportunities.</li>
 	<li>Employers who wish to recruit at the University of Mary Washington must refer to the <a href="http://www.naceweb.org/career-development/organizational-structure/principles-for-professional-practice/">Principles for Professional Practice for Employment Professionals</a>, created by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.</li>
 	<li>We will support and approve internship postings that are learning experiences for our students. Admin and clerical internships may not be approved.</li>
 	<li>We WILL NOT allow any postings from private families/individuals. This includes, but is not limited to: personal care assistants, house cleaning, nannies, tutors, and pet care.</li>
</ul>
