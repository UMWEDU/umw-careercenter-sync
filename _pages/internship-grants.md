<h3 class="entry-title"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<div class="entry-content">

The University has a limited number of grant awards intended to provide support to students pursuing unpaid internships, particularly unpaid summer internships. These funds are a result of the generosity of donations from alumni, parents, and friends of the University. Awards typically range from between $500 and $2000 and are intended to provide funding support for eligible students who are participating in a significant <strong>unpaid</strong> internship experience.

Internship grants are competitively awarded through a selection process administered by the Center for Career and Professional Development. The CCPD is responsible for announcing opportunities to students, managing the receipt of applications, and working with institutional sponsors to support the selection and end-of-experience reporting requirements.

In order to learn more about our various internship grants, find out if you are eligible, and apply, please visit the <a href="https://umw.scholarships.ngwebsolutions.com/CMXAdmin/Cmx_Content.aspx?cpId=1046">Career Center Internship Grant Application</a> page.
