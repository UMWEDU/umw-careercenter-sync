If you are a University of Mary Washington student with a disability, you are welcome to participate in our annual Workforce Recruitment Program (WRP), sponsored by the federal government. This program provides an opportunity for eligible students and graduates to be interviewed by a federal recruiter for internships, co-ops, or even permanent employment.

<strong>Who is Eligible to Participate in WRP?</strong>

An applicant for the program must:
<ul>
 	<li>Have a substantial disability</li>
 	<li>Be a United States citizen</li>
 	<li>Be enrolled in an accredited institution of higher learning on a substantially full-time basis (unless the severity of the disability precludes the student from taking a substantially full-time course load) to seek a degree</li>
 	<li>Be enrolled in such an institution as a degree-seeking student taking less than a substantially full-time course load in the enrollment period immediately preceding graduation</li>
 	<li>Have graduated from such an institution within the past year</li>
</ul>
<strong>Benefits to College Students</strong>

With the Workforce Recruitment Program, students can:
<ul>

 	<li>Communicate with a WRP recruiter in a one-to-one meeting to discuss opportunities and refine their interviewing skills</li>
 	<li>Earn additional experience and expand their network of contacts while on the job</li>
 	<li>Demonstrate that students with disabilities can make fantastic employees</li>
</ul>
