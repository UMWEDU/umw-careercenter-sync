If you are a University of Mary Washington student with a disability, you are welcome to participate in our annual Workforce Recruitment Program (WRP), sponsored by the federal government. This program provides an opportunity for eligible students and graduates to be interviewed by a federal recruiter for internships, co-ops, or even permanent employment. <span class="ng-scope">The WRP is not a guarantee of employment, though it improves your chances of receiving federal opportunities. WRP candidates should continue to pursue other opportunities in addition to WRP.</span>

<strong>Who is Eligible to Participate in WRP?</strong>

<ul>
 	<li>Have a substantial disability</li>
 	<li>Be a United States citizen</li>
 	<li>Be enrolled in an accredited institution of higher learning on a substantially full-time basis (unless the severity of the disability precludes the student from taking a substantially full-time course load) to seek a degree</li>
 	<li>Be enrolled in such an institution as a degree-seeking student taking less than a substantially full-time course load in the enrollment period immediately preceding graduation</li>
 	<li>Have graduated from such an institution within the past year</li>
