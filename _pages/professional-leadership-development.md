Resume and interview support + leadership experience

Peace Corps service and similar international development work opportunities are highly professional and selective. PC Prep requires <strong>three specific activities </strong>that will strengthen your candidacy for the Peace Corps (or any other professional endeavor):
<ol>
 	<li>Have your <strong>resume </strong>critiqued by someone in the Center for Career and Professional Development.</li>
 	<li>Attend a workshop or class on <strong>interview skills </strong>at the Center for Career and Professional Development.</li>
 	<li>Develop at least one significant <strong>leadership experience </strong>and be prepared to discuss it thoughtfully. For example, organizing a campus event, leading a work or volunteer project, or serving on the executive board of a student organization.</li>
</ol>
