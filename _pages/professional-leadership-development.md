[tabby title="Leadership Experience"]
<h4><strong><span style="color: #003366">Leadership Experience
</span></strong></h4>
Develop at least one significant leadership experience and be prepared to discuss it thoughtfully. For example, organizing a campus event, leading a work or volunteer project, or serving on the executive board of a student organization.

Participation in one of UMW’s formal leadership programs organized through the Center for Honor, Leadership, and Service. For example, the Horizons Program offers students the opportunity to develop as individuals, leaders and scholars over the course of their college experience. The Program has three required components (educational, experiential, and reflection) which can be completed in several different ways. Students build foundations through engagement with the community, discover ways in which the individual can contribute to others, and explore ways in which they are empowered to make positive changes in the world.
