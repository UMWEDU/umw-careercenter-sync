<h2>Are you ready to be a graduate student?</h2>
<h3>You'll need to be prepared to...</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Invest substantial time, energy, and money. Have you thoroughly investigated these costs?</li>
 	<li>Spend the majority of the next 2-7 years studying. Will you be able to handle your living expenses during this time?</li>
 	<li>Concentrate on a single topic or narrow range of topics for the next 2-7 years. Will you stay interested?</li>
 	<li>Remain in school for several more years. Are you sure you don't need a break from school?</li>
 	<li>Defer any career-related work experience. Or, would work experience now help you get into graduate school later?</li>
 	<li>Initiate and carry out independent research. Are you comfortable with that?</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you think Graduate School is the right step, think about:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Where you want to go to graduate school? (Location)</li>
 	<li>What type of program are you considering? (Full-Time, Part Time)</li>
 	<li>Do you need financial assistance? (Assistantships, TA positions, etc. )</li>
 	<li>How long will it take to complete graduate school? (Length of program)</li>
 	<li>What are the admission requirements? (Do you need the GMAT, GRE, LSAT)</li>
 	<li>When should I apply? (What are the deadlines)</li>
</ul>
