<strong>Internship Contract Completion Policies: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Deadlines for registering for academic credit are established each semester. Individual departments may have additional, earlier deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Consider your internship dates. Do they fall within the dates outlined on the contract?</li>
 	<li>Complete the information requested on the top part of the contract.</li>
 	<li>Meet with the internship supervisor and have him/her complete the section headed TO BE COMPLETED BY THE AGENCY SUPERVISOR. <strong>A list of duties must be attached for an internship to be considered complete.</strong> The duties may involve no more than 30% clerical work.

 	<li>Obtain the signature of the chair from the department granting credit.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Receiving Credit:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Credit is awarded based on academic work assigned for the internship, the quality of the work performed at the internship, and the number of site hours worked. Time spent at an internship does not guarantee a set number of credit hours, but a minimum number of hours is necessary for all levels of credit.</li>
 	<li>An internship may be graded or P/F. The grading method is determined by the faculty sponsor and is subject to departmental guidelines.</li>
 	<li>A minimum of 42 site hours is required per credit hour. At least 84 hours are required for two credits. At least 126 hours are required for three credits.</li>
 	<li>Credit is awarded for the semester in which the internship takes place.</li>
 	<li><strong>No credit is awarded retroactively</strong>. All paperwork must be completed within seven days of starting the internship. Any exception must be approved in advance by the internship coordinator.</li>
 	<li>Students may accrue no more than 12 experiential credits towards graduation and no more than 55 credits in any one discipline.</li>
 	<li>In order to drop an internship, a student must contact the Center for Career and Professional Development, along with their faculty sponsor and the site. The student must also contact the <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/registrar/">Registrar's Office</a> to drop the internship. The internship is not considered officially dropped from your schedule until you have followed up and completed the steps given to you by the Registrar's Office.</li>
 	<li>Students who participate in an internship as part of an educational study abroad program must also obtain the approval of the Director of the Center for International Education (CIE).</li>
 	<li>Students attempting to take <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/academic_policies/overload/">more than 18 credit hours</a> with the addtion of an internship will need approval from the Director of <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/academicandcareerservices/">Academic Services</a>.</li>

<strong>Internship Fee Policies: </strong>

 	<li>There is also a per credit charge for internships taken by part-time, degree-seeking students at any time of the year.</li>
 	<li>Students registering for internships after the deadline may be required to pay for the internship up front, before the internship can be added to their schedule.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Special Consideration Policies:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>If you have previously volunteered, worked, or interned at an internship site and registered the experience for credit, you must submit with your contract:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li>A letter explaining how the pending experience will differ from the previous experience and how it will relate to your coursework.</li>
 	<li>Acquire signatures from both your agency supervisor and your faculty sponsor indicating their support and agreement with your letter. This can be done at the bottom of the letter you provide.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>If you wish to do an internship for 4 to 6 hours of credit, you must submit with your contract:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li>A letter explaining what additional skills and experiences you will be able to participate in as a result of the additional time at the internship. While 42 site hours are required for each additional credit hour, time spent at the site does not justify additional credit. The decision to award additional credit is based on what is done as a result of those hours. Some majors will not grant more than 3 credit hours per internship.</li>
 	<li>Acquire signatures from both your agency supervisor and your faculty sponsor indicating their support and agreement with your letter. This can be done at the bottom of the letter you provide.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Additional Policies: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The internship site supervisor and faculty supervisor cannot be the same individual.</li>
 	<li>Students are not allowed to be supervised by immediate family members or to intern in their residences.</li>
 	<li>Internship credit may be transferred from another institution under the same regulations as other transfer credits.</li>
 	<li>Credits transferred from another institution count towards the maximum total experiential credits allowed by the University of Mary Washington.</li>
