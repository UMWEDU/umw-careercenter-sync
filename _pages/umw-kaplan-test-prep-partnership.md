A partnership between the UMW Pre-Health Program, UMW Continuing Education, and Kaplan Test Prep has been established that provides UMW Premed students with Kaplan MCAT Test Prep courses at a significantly reduced rate.

UMW Premed students can enroll in Kaplan MCAT In-Person or Live-Online courses at a cost to the student of $1625, a savings of $874!!

The In-Person Course offers live, in-person instruction at a number of locations in Virginia and Washington DC, while the Live-Online Course offers the same instruction delivered online over Kaplanâ€™s exclusive MCAT Channel, live or recorded.

For more information, please email the UMW Pre-Health Advisor, Professor Stephen Gallik, <a href="mailto:sgallik@umw.edu">sgallik@umw.edu</a>
