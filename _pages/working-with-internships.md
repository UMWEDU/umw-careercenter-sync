The Center for Career and Professional Development (CCPD) coordinates undergraduate academic internships for credit (designated by course number 499), putting qualified students to work both on and off campus. UMW faculty members play an important part in this process. Students wishing to complete for-credit internships must work with a faculty sponsor in their department, the department chair, an on-site supervisor, and the CCPD internship coordinator. Check out our current <a href="http://www.umw.edu/careercenter/students/internships/credit/">internship policies</a>.
<h2>Before</h2>
Students can work with the CCPD to find internships. Once they have identified an internship to pursue, they must complete the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/careercenter/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2016/08/InternshipContract.pdf">academic internship contract</a>. Part of this contract must be completed by a faculty member. Please use the following guidelines when reviewing a student’s internship contract:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Review the list of duties</strong> the student will complete at the internship site. Students should attach a list of responsibilities to their contract for faculty review.</li>
 	<li><strong>Review the dates</strong>. Do the dates fall within the academic term. If the student’s internship will span beyond those dates, the internship coordinator will need your approval to request a G grade for the student.</li>
 	<li><strong>Discuss the goal of the internship</strong> with the student. They should have a clear idea what their educational goal is when the internship is complete.</li>
 	<li><strong>Set the expectations for successful completion.</strong> Speak with the student about what they will be expected to do during the internship and what they will need to complete at the end of the internship experience. Will they write a paper? Are they expected to meet with you weekly? How should they communicate with you during the internship?</li>
 	<li><strong>Review the time commitment.</strong> For each credit earned, 42 hours of on-site work must be completed. Time spent on assignments, meetings with faculty, on commuting, cannot be counted toward the 42 hours.</li>
 	<li><strong>Complete all required fields.</strong> The amount of credits agreed upon, the major granting credit, where the credit is to be applied, and a signature should all be completed.</li>
</ol>
Three-credit internships are the most common, but for most majors, it is possible for a student to request four to six credits for an internship. This requires a type-written statement from the student that justifies the additional credit. Note that simply doing <strong>more of the same duties</strong> does not justify additional credit. The experience must be deeper and incorporate higher level duties or are more extensive than the three-credit version of the same internship.

<strong>Credit is not awarded retroactively. </strong>Students must have their internship contracts completed and turned in within one week of the internship starting. Deadlines can be found on the academic calendar.
<h2>During</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Throughout the internship, you dictate how often and by what means the student communicates with you about their internship experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>After:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>The student should turn in all assignments to you at the close of the academic term.</li>
 	<li>If a student will extend past the end of the academic term, the internship coordinator will need to request a G grade for the student.</li>
 	<li>You will be sent an evaluation from the internship site in most cases. In a few rare circumstances, a site does not provide feedback via our evaluation form. We will try to have the student send their evaluation to you in those cases.</li>
 	<li>The internship coordinator makes every attempt to request evaluations from internship sites. In some cases, the email address given by the student is incorrect or there is no response from the site. After three attempts, we generally ask the student to try and track down their evaluation.</li>
 	<li>Your student will be required to complete an evaluation from the Career Center at the close of the internship. You will be emailed if there are any issues or discrepancies concerning internship completion.</li>
</ul>
