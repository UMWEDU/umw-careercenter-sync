<strong>Academic Internships –Overview for Faculty</strong>

Internships provide structured learning experiences and must be evaluated by a faculty member and approved in advance by the department the student is seeking academic credit from. Credit is only awarded for internships that incorporate a hands-on experience per the duties outlined in the contract, and includes academic components which are determined at the discretion of the faculty sponsor. Requested internships should provide an opportunity for students to apply and supplement the knowledge gained in the classroom. Academic departments have the final decision for the approval of an academic internship.

Here is a list of things to discuss with your student regarding academic internships:

<strong>Helping your Student Find and Secure an Internship</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.umw.edu/careercenter/handshake/">Handshake</a> – UMW’s job and internship portal for students and alumni. Students can search for internships by keyword, major, location, etc.</li>
 	<li>Students can always make an appointment at the <a href="https://www.umw.edu/careercenter/">Career Center</a> – Our counselors can help to navigate the internship search through one-on-one appointments and workshops, resume and cover letter reviews, and interviewing skills.</li>
 	<li>Your connections – If you know employers who are looking for interns in your field, share their contact information with your student.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Role of the Faculty Sponsor</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Students need to have approval from a faculty sponsor and their Department Chair in order to have their internship approved for credit. Faculty sponsors will meet with students throughout their internship to assess their progress. Students should also be assigned academic work to go along with the internship.</li>
 	<li>Things to think about include:</li>
 	<li>Does the internship meet department regulations and policies?</li>
 	<li>Has the student met all criteria to do an internship? (see policies below)</li>
 	<li>If you are meeting with an international student, have they met with CIE prior to securing the internship?</li>
 	<li>What are the duties at the internship site?</li>
 	<li>How will the student be evaluated and how will a grade be assigned?</li>
 	<li>What type of academic work will be assigned along with the internship?</li>
 	<li>How often do you expect the student to meet with you throughout their internship?</li>
 	<li>How many hours will the student be working, and how many credits will they earn based on those hours?</li>
 	<li>If the internship runs past the end of the semester, are you willing to assign a ‘G’ grade and evaluate their performance upon completion of the academic component of the internship?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Academic Internship Criteria and Policies for Students</strong>
