<h3 class="entry-title"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<div class="entry-content">

The University has a limited number of grant awards intended to provide support to students pursuing unpaid internships, particularly unpaid summer internships. These funds are a result of the generosity of donations from alumni, parents, and friends of the University. Awards typically range from between $500 and $2000 and are intended to provide funding support for eligible students who are participating in a significant <strong>unpaid</strong> internship experience.

One grant will be designated for a student completing a green internship at a location that focuses on <em>environmental or social responsibility.</em>

Internship grants are competitively awarded through a selection process administered by the Center for Career and Professional Development. The CCPD is responsible for announcing opportunities to students, managing the receipt of applications, and working with institutional sponsors to support the selection and end-of-experience reporting requirements.

<strong>Criteria</strong>

To be eligible for financial awards, students must meet the following criteria:
<ul>
 	<li>12 credit hours completed at UMW prior to the internship;</li>
 	<li>2.5 GPA at the time of application;</li>
 	<li>Planned enrollment at least one semester after the end of the internship;</li>
 	<li>Seeking an unpaid internship (if you receive a stipend, you are not eligible to apply) consisting of a minimum of 126 contact hours to be eligible for the maximum award;</li>
 	<li>A completed online award application</li>
</ul>
<strong>Additional Requirements</strong>

Recipients are not required to enroll for academic credit, however a completed and approved internship application must be on file with the CCPD prior to the disbursement of the award and the experience should involve at least 126 contact hours to be eligible for the largest award ($2000).  If you are doing an internship attached to credit, you will need the Summer 2017 Internship Contract (this will be available after spring break). If you are doing an internship that is not attached to academic credit, you will need the  <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/academicservices/files/2015/03/Grant-Internship-Contract-revised.pdf">Summer Grant Internship Contract-Non Credit</a>. Reviewers will consider the duration of the internship and the number of contact hours in considering the amount of the award. In addition, these cash awards require students to complete a W-9 and recipients will be responsible for any applicable federal, state, or local taxes. Students who receive a financial award to support their internship experience are required to submit an end-of-experience report that includes a brief (2 page) reflection on the experience and a thank you note to the sponsor. These awards may be used for student internship expenses, stipends, and travel. Prior to disbursement, students must be cleared by Financial Aid and Student Accounts as awards will not be processed for payment to recipients who have outstanding balances.

<strong>Application Materials</strong>

In 2017, applications must be submitted online at the CCPD website (with the exception of hard copies of reference letters which may be turned in or addressed to the Center for Career and Professional Development, UC Suite 206). A complete application includes: (1) online Internship Grant Application, (2) an internship contract, and (3) one letter of reference.

Applications are due  by 4/25/17 at 5 p.m. and recipients will be notified the week of May 1, 2017.
