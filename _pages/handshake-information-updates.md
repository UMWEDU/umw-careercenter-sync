<strong>Introducing Handshake</strong>
Handshake, the new system replacing Employ-An-Eagle, is a completely new design.  It’s a combination of some of the best tools on the web today, taken from services like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest.  It’s designed to help us precisely target career information, internship, Co-op, and employment opportunities, and career related events to student’s specific major, degree type, and interests.  The transition to Handshake represents a significant milestone in the continuing evolution of our office and the way in which we deliver services to our alumni, employers, faculty and staff, and students here at UMW.  Implementation will begin during the Summer 2017 term.

&nbsp;
<strong>Why Handshake?</strong>
We chose Handshake as our new technology platform because of the wealth of features and functionality it offers to our users.  For example, Handshake provides:

•    A customizable, personalized experience for all of our users
•    An intuitive design that’s easy to learn and use
•    A set of fast and powerful search tools for both job seekers and recruiters
•    The ability to have access to jobs on a local, regional, and national scale
•    Better access to internships and other career development opportunities
•    An iOS ready mobile app

<strong>Who is Handshake?</strong>
Handshake is a cutting-edge, start-up technology firm that specializes in software for running career services offices. Launched in 2014, and currently based in San Francisco, Handshake is used on over 60 U.S. university campuses, including schools like Stanford University, the University of Michigan, Cornell University, Villanova University, Wake Forest University, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Chicago, and the  University of Miami. The company’s platform is also used by recruiters at over 50% of Fortune 500 companies.  Handshake’s novel approach to handling employers and recruiters will enable UMW to provide students and alumni with access to internship and employment opportunities on a scale that was simply not possible on our old technology platform.  With the click of a button, employers will be able to share all of their opportunities with UMW students and alumni, opening regional, national, and international career paths.
