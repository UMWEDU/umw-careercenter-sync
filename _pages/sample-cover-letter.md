Ms. Amy Wallace
Director of Compliance
International Consulting
1234 Business Drive
Fredericksburg, VA 22401

Dear Ms. Wallace:

State what you are applying for. State where you heard about the open position. This information helps the employer know where to continue to advertise. The information is especially helpful to include when a mutual acquaintance has recommended you for the position, so include his or her name/title.

Discuss why you are interested in the position by focusing on what you learned about the company through your research. Mention why you think the company is a good fit for you (values/goals). Write about who you are, but keep it short. Do not repeat, verbatim, information that is on your resume.

If you are applying for an advertised position, discuss two to three qualifications and/or skills that the employer is seeking. State that you have the skills and <u>provide an example</u> of a time when you obtained or used the skill.

You may also briefly mention that you have a few of the other qualifications that the employer is seeking without providing examples. Some employers prefer a story line of how your interests evolved interwoven with information about your background, experiences, and education. This is especially helpful if you are changing career direction. The middle section of the cover letter may be broken into two paragraphs.

Acknowledge what the next step will be: You will wait to hear from the employer or you will contact the employer. If you choose the second choice, provide a general date of contact. Thank the employer for reviewing your résumé, and note that you are looking forward to an interview. Provide your contact information such as an email address and phone number.

&nbsp;

Sincerely,

&nbsp;

Susan Smith
