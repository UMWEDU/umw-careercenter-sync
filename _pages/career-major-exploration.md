<a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh"><strong>The Occupational Outlook Handbook</strong></a><b> </b>can help you find career information on duties, education, and training, pay, and the outlook for hundreds of occupations.

<a href="http://www.naceweb.org/knowledge/career-readiness-competencies.aspx"><b>Career Readiness Defined </b></a>

The National Association of Colleges and Employers, through a task force of college career services and HR/staffing professionals, has developed a definition, based on extensive research among employers, and identified seven competencies associated with career readiness.

Our liberal arts and sciences curriculum – with more than 60 majors, minors, and courses of study – will challenge your mind and let you explore.

<a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/general-education/"><b>UMW General Education Requirements</b></a>

The University of Mary Washington has two different sets of general education requirements.

The <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/general-education/general-education-requirements-for-bachelor-of-artsbachelor-of-science-degrees/">general education requirements for Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science degrees</a> apply to all students who are seeking to earn an undergraduate B.A. or B.S. diploma.

Students seeking a Bachelor of Liberal Studies degree have a separate set of <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/general-education/bachelor-of-liberal-studies-general-education-requirements/">BLS general education requirements</a>.

The <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/general-education/general-education-course-list/">general education course list</a>, which indicates the courses that satisfy a particular general education requirement, applies to both general education programs.

It’s helpful for students to remember that they have four years to fulfill all graduation requirements, and they should not view the completion of general education requirements and the major as two separate activities. In fact, many of the courses that will satisfy general education requirements are upper-level courses that one might think about taking after selecting a major. In this way, the selected general education courses will connect well with the intended major course of study.
